Simplified Plots for Communicating Target Reliability

## the scripts will be uploaded as soon as the article will be published

The scripts with names beginning with “MAIN” are the main scripts where all the inputs are defined and the calculations are performed. All the other scripts are called from the main scripts.
•	MAIN_Create_plots_for_optimal_relaibility.m – Creates the plots proposed for communicating optimal target reliabilities.

The scripts make use of functions in the following packages:
•	FERUMcore and FERUMsystems_MSR packages available at http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/ferum/. 
•	Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (see https://se.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html )
